Simple algebraic simplifier for common lisp

It's easy to use, just try something like that:

(simplifier:simplify '(+ 654 f 7560 d 0)) => '(+ f 8214 d) 
(simplifier:simplify '(+ d f (- d)) => f
(simplifier:simplify '(- 5 d (- d) 6) => -1

And so on. It is based on stupid patter matching algorithm. You can add
your own rules in simplifier:*rules*. See comments inside source to learn how
to do it.
